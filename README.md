# Elixir Guides

Source files that can be used to follow along the [Elixir Guides](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html).

I am not affiliated with Elixir in any way, but I am merely an engineer who finds the language useful.

This is my small contribution to the community. I will keep the source files updated by revisiting the Elixir Guides every so often.

Thank you and take care.
